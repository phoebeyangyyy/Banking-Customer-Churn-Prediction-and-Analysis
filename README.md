# Banking-Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Analysis

Customer churn is a major problem of customers leaving your products/subscription and moving to another service. To retain them, they need to identify the customers as well as the reason for churning so that they can provide the customers with personalized offers and products.

This project aims to identify customers who are likely to churn in the future using supervised learning models. Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K Nearest Neighbor are tuned for best-achieving performance. The best-performed model is Random Forest with a 0.8576 Accuracy in the test set.

Furthermore, I analyze the top factors that influence user retention. The end outcome is that Age becomes the most important feature, is positively correlated to the probability that a customer will exit.
